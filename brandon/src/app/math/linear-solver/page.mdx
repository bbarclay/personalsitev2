# Linear Solvers

<Callout type="info">
  A linear solver is an algorithm or method used to find a solution to a system of linear equations.
</Callout>

## Introduction

Linear solvers are fundamental tools in computational mathematics and scientific computing. They are used to find solutions to systems of linear equations, which can be represented in the form:

$$Ax = b$$

Where:
- $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix of coefficients
- $x$ is an $n \times 1$ vector of unknowns
- $b$ is an $m \times 1$ vector of constants

## Types of Linear Solvers

Linear solvers can be broadly categorized into two types:

1. **Direct Methods** - These methods provide an exact solution (up to machine precision) in a finite number of steps
   - [Gaussian Elimination](/linear-solver/direct-methods/gaussian-elimination)
   - [LU Decomposition](/linear-solver/direct-methods/lu-decomposition)
   - [Cholesky Decomposition](/linear-solver/direct-methods/cholesky-decomposition)

2. **Iterative Methods** - These methods start with an initial guess and iteratively improve the solution
   - [Jacobi Method](/linear-solver/iterative-methods/jacobi)
   - [Gauss-Seidel Method](/linear-solver/iterative-methods/gauss-seidel)
   - [Conjugate Gradient Method](/linear-solver/iterative-methods/conjugate-gradient)

## Applications

Linear solvers have applications in various fields including:

- Structural analysis
- Circuit analysis
- Image processing
- Machine learning and data science
- Computational fluid dynamics
- Financial modeling

## Mathematical Foundation

The study of linear solvers is closely tied to [Linear Algebra](/linear-solver/concepts/linear-algebra) and the properties of matrices such as:

- [Matrix Operations](/linear-solver/concepts/matrix-operations)
- [Matrix Decompositions](/linear-solver/concepts/matrix-decompositions)
- [Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors](/linear-solver/concepts/eigenvalues)
- [Matrix Conditioning](/linear-solver/concepts/conditioning)

## Computational Considerations

When implementing linear solvers, several factors need to be considered:

- [Numerical Stability](/linear-solver/computational/numerical-stability)
- [Computational Complexity](/linear-solver/computational/complexity)
- [Sparse Matrix Techniques](/linear-solver/computational/sparse-matrices)
- [Parallel Computing Approaches](/linear-solver/computational/parallel-computing)
