# Matrix Conditioning

<Callout type="info">
  The condition number of a matrix measures how sensitive the solution of a linear system is to errors in the input data.
</Callout>

## Definition

For a matrix $A$, the condition number $\kappa(A)$ with respect to a matrix norm is defined as:

$$\kappa(A) = \|A\| \cdot \|A^{-1}\|$$

For the commonly used 2-norm, this becomes:

$$\kappa_2(A) = \frac{\sigma_{\max}}{\sigma_{\min}}$$

where $\sigma_{\max}$ and $\sigma_{\min}$ are the largest and smallest singular values of $A$, respectively.

## Interpretation

The condition number provides important information about a matrix:

- $\kappa(A) \approx 1$: The matrix is well-conditioned
- $\kappa(A) \gg 1$: The matrix is ill-conditioned
- $\kappa(A) = \infty$: The matrix is singular

## Impact on Linear Systems

For a linear system $Ax = b$, the condition number bounds the relative error in the solution:

$$\frac{\|\Delta x\|}{\|x\|} \leq \kappa(A) \cdot \frac{\|\Delta b\|}{\|b\|}$$

This means that a small relative change in $b$ can result in a much larger relative change in the solution $x$ if the condition number is large.

## Examples

### Well-conditioned Matrix

Consider the identity matrix $I$. Its condition number is:

$$\kappa(I) = 1$$

This means the solution to $Ix = b$ is completely stable with respect to changes in $b$.

### Ill-conditioned Matrix

Consider the Hilbert matrix of order $n$, defined by $H_{ij} = \frac{1}{i+j-1}$. For $n = 10$, the condition number is approximately:

$$\kappa(H_{10}) \approx 1.6 \times 10^{13}$$

This extremely large condition number means that solving a system with the Hilbert matrix can be numerically challenging.

## Computing Condition Numbers

In practice, computing the exact condition number requires finding the singular values, which can be expensive. Alternative methods include:

1. **Power iteration**: Estimates the largest and smallest singular values
2. **Norm estimation**: Uses stochastic methods to estimate matrix norms
3. **Condition number estimators**: Available in numerical libraries like LAPACK

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import linalg

# Creating a matrix
A = np.array([[4, 2, 1], [2, 4, 2], [1, 2, 4]])

# Computing condition number with respect to 2-norm
cond_num = np.linalg.cond(A, 2)
print(f"Condition number: {cond_num}")
```

## Effect on Different Solver Types

### Direct Methods
- **Well-conditioned**: Generally provide accurate solutions
- **Ill-conditioned**: May suffer from significant numerical errors

### Iterative Methods
- **Well-conditioned**: Converge rapidly
- **Ill-conditioned**: Converge slowly or fail to converge

## Improving Conditioning

Several techniques can improve the conditioning of a linear system:

1. **Scaling**: Multiply rows or columns by constants to balance the matrix
2. **Preconditioning**: Transform the system into an equivalent, better-conditioned one
3. **Regularization**: Add small values to diagonal elements to reduce condition number
4. **Alternative formulations**: Reformulate the problem to avoid ill-conditioning

## Practical Considerations

<Callout type="warning">
  In finite-precision arithmetic, a rule of thumb is that you may lose up to log₁₀(κ(A)) digits of accuracy in the solution.
</Callout>

When working with ill-conditioned matrices:
- Use higher precision arithmetic if available
- Consider iterative refinement techniques
- Monitor residuals to assess solution quality
- Consider alternative problem formulations
